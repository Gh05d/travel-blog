        Davina backpacked through Southeast Asia on $25/day when she was 22 and
        got hooked on the puzzle of traveling cheap without traveling badly.
        She's since refined her approach across 45 countries—finding the flight
        hacks, the shoulder-season sweet spots, and the apps that actually save
        money.

      <p>
        Her writing covers <strong>budget travel</strong>,
        <strong>travel hacks</strong>, and <strong>practical planning</strong>,
        with specific numbers and real costs. She won't tell you a destination
        is "affordable" without telling you what affordable actually means.
