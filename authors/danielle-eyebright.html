      <p>
        Danielle took her first solo trip at 23 after a breakup left her with
        non-refundable tickets to Morocco. She's since traveled alone through
        60+ countries, including destinations her mother still doesn't know
        about.
      </p>
      <p>
        She writes about <strong>solo travel</strong>,
        <strong>travel safety</strong>, and <strong>female solo travel</strong>,
        covering the real stuff: how to read a room, when to trust your gut,
        which hostels have good locks. No toxic positivity—just practical advice
        from someone who's learned some lessons the hard way.

        Based in Berlin. Carries a doorstop wedge in every bag.
