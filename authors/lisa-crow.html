        Lisa covered clinical health research for eight years before burning out
        and booking a one-way ticket to Bali. That trip turned into two years
        visiting thermal baths, silent retreats, and high-end spas across 25
        countries—reviewing what actually works versus what's just expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        She writes about <strong>wellness retreats</strong>,
        <strong>luxury resorts</strong>, and <strong>spa destinations</strong>,
        with a focus on whether the experience justifies the price tag. She's
        done the $40/night ashram and the $4,000/night resort, and she'll tell
        you which one changed her more.
