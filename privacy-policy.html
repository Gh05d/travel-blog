            consent has been given to the setting of further (optional) cookies
            or whether such storage has been rejected. The strictly necessary
            cookies, including their purpose and storage or deletion period, are

            interactions in general.

          <h2>10. Technologies used on this site</h2>
          <p>
            Here are the different technologies we use on this site and it's
            purpose:
          </p>

          <h3>Fonts (Google Fonts)</h3>
          <p>
            To display the content of the website correctly and graphically
            appealing across browsers, the Web Fonts font library provided by
            Google Ireland Ltd. in Ireland is used to make the website
            available. The provider acts as a data processor based on a data
            processing agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            When a website on which a font library is integrated is accessed,
            the required font is loaded into the browser cache to display texts
            and fonts correctly. Google receives the information that the font
            required for the website has been called up from the IP address of
            the website visitor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal data may be transferred to third countries that do not
            offer an adequate level of data protection. In this case, it is
            ensured that appropriate safeguards are provided for such a transfer
            in order to ensure an adequate level of data protection. The
            Controller will provide evidence of these appropriate safeguards on
            request.
          </p>

          <p>
            The legal basis for this data processing is the Controller's
            legitimate interest in a uniform and legible presentation of the
            website across all devices. If consent has been obtained, the
            expressly granted consent, which can be revoked at any time,
            constitutes the legal basis.
          </p>

          <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
          <p>
            The website uses the Google AdSense advertising service provided by
            Google Ireland Limited in Ireland. The provider acts as a data
            processor on the basis of a data processing agreement.
          </p>

          <p>
            AdSense makes it possible to display targeted advertisements from
            third parties on the website or to have them displayed by Google.
            The content of the advertisements is selected based on the interests
            and previous user behavior of the website visitors. Google AdSense
            uses cookies and so-called "web beacons" (small invisible graphics)
            and device fingerprints (which can be used to recognize end devices
            based on the configuration).
          </p>

          <p>
            Personal data may be transferred to third countries that do not
            offer an adequate level of data protection. In this case, it is
            ensured that appropriate safeguards are provided for such a transfer
            in order to ensure an adequate level of data protection. The
            Controller will provide evidence of these appropriate safeguards on
            request.
          </p>

          <p>
            The legal basis for this data processing is the express consent of
            the website visitor. If no consent has been given, the legal basis
            for this data processing is our legitimate interest Our overriding
            legitimate interest is the above-mentioned purposes.
          </p>

          <h3>Tracking-Pixel</h3>
          <p>
            Tracking pixels and cookies from various providers, e.g. LinkedIn,
            Bing, Meta, Google, Outbrain, Pinterest, Snapchat, Taboola, TikTok,
            Twitter and/or Yahoo Native (Gemini), are used on the website to
            track the use of the website and the actions of website visitors for
            the purpose of conversion tracking.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tracking pixels are a code snippet that can be used to track the
            actions of visitors to the website, which makes it possible to
            personalize and improve advertisements and measure their success. In
            this way, the use of the website can be evaluated for statistical
            and market research purposes and advertising campaigns can be
            optimized.
          </p>

          <p>
            The data collected via the tracking pixels can be used by the
            providers of the respective pixels for their own tracking and
            advertising purposes. Further details can be found in the Privacy
            Policies of the providers of the respective pixels.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a visitor to the website is a member of a social media platform
            of one of the providers of the tracking pixels and has allowed the
            respective provider to do so via the settings of the user account
            with the social media network, the provider of the social media
            network or tracking pixel can link the information collected about
            the visit to the website with the associated user account with the
            respective social media network and use it for the targeted
            placement of advertisements.
          </p>

          <p>
            The website provider can also measure the effectiveness of
            advertisements in the respective social media networks and see
            whether a user was redirected to the website via such advertisements
            (conversion measurement).
          </p>

          <p>
            When such tracking pixels are integrated, personal data may be
            transferred to third countries that do not offer an adequate level
            of data protection. In this case, it is ensured that appropriate
            safeguards are provided for such a transfer in order to ensure an
            adequate level of data protection. The Controller will provide
            evidence of these appropriate safeguards on request.
          </p>

          <p>
            The legal basis for this data processing, including the transfer of
            data to LinkedIn, is the express consent of the visitor to the
            website.

          <h2>11. Mandatory Information and Profiling</h2>
          <p>
            The provision of personal data is neither legally nor contractually
            required, except where necessary to conclude or execute a contract.
            Automated decision‑making, including profiling, is not carried out.
